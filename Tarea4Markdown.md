## Preparing the environment, cleaning the data for Stacks

**1.-**  First, we will create a set of directories to place data in. At each step of the analysis, we will transform the data moving it from the `raw`/ to `samples`/ to `stacks`/. 

**2.-** We will assume that you have placed the `raw` sequencing data into the raw/ directory. If you are using the raw files output by the BUSTARD part of the pipeline your data will look like this: 

```

If, instead, you are using the output of the GERALD part of the Illumina pipeline, your data will be a little simpler: 

```
~/tutorial/raw% ls s_1_sequence.txt
```

**3.-** The next step is to create a file containing our five barcodes. Using a convenient editor, place the barcodes alone in a file, one per line. 

```
~/tutorial% vi barcodes 
~/tutorial% more barcodes 
CGATA 
GAAGC 
TGACC 
AACCC 
ACTGC

```

After the last two steps, our working directory should look like this: 

```
~/tutorial% ls barcodes raw/ samples/ stacks/
```
